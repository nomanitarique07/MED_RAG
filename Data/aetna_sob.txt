| What is the overall deductible?                             | In-Network: Individual $5,000 / Family $10,000.                                                         | Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all family members meets the overall family deductible.                                                                                                                           |
| Are there services covered before you meet your deductible? | Yes. Certain office visits, preventive care and urgent care in-network.                                 | This plan covers some items and services even if you haven ' t yet met the deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost sharing and before you meet your deductible.

| Are there other deductibles for specific services?          | No.                                                                                                     | You don ' t have to meet deductibles for specific services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| What is the out-of-pocket limit for this plan?              | In-Network: Individual $8,000 / Family $16,000.                                                         | The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you have other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit?            | Premiums and health care this plan doesn't cover.                                                       | Even though you pay these expenses, they don ' t count toward the out-of-pocket limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Will you pay less if you use a network provider?            | Yes. See https://aet.na/providersearch_aetna or call 1-844-365-7373 for a list of in-network providers. | This plan uses a provider network. You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan ' s network. You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network provider, and you might receive a bill from a provider for the difference between the provider's charge and what your plan pays (balance billing). Be aware, your network provider might use an out-of-network provider for some services (such as lab work). Check with your provider before you get services. |
| Do you need a referral to see a specialist?                 | Yes.                                                                                                    | This plan will pay some or all of the costs to see a specialist for covered services but only if you have a referral before you see the specialist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
